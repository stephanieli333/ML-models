# ML-models
This project consists of machine learning models implemented for COMP 551 as part of group projects with two other colleagues. 
Each folder corresponds to a separate project that deals with select datasets. References to the datasets can be found in the PDFs described below. 

A PDF report accompanies each folder, detailing the process of data preprocessing, model optimization (e.g. hyperparameter tuning, variations on gradient descent, bagging, boosting), evaluating the effectiveness of our models (using methods like cross validation, out-of-bag validation), and suggesting room for further work based on recent literature.


A brief overview of the contents of each folder:

A1 contains code that involves a from-scratch implementation of logistic regression and naive Bayes trained on 4 datasets: Breast Cancer, Ionosphere, Adult, and Banknote. 

The code in A2 makes use of pre-implemented models from scikit-learn. Models include decision tree, random forest, adaboost, linear SVC, linear regression, radial basis function SVM, and BERT. We trained these models on text-based datasets, IMDB and 20 Newsgroups.

A3 includes from-scratch implementations of a feed-forward neural net and a convolutional neural net to learn from images. We trained these models on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
